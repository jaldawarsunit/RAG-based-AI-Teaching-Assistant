    "text": " In today's video, I will tell you what is Python Pandas and how you can use Python Pandas effectively in your data science projects. Pandas is a Python library that helps you in data analysis. It helps you from data manipulation to data cleaning and data pre-processing. In today's video, we will see how you can use Pandas in the shortest time and how you can do more data analysis than Pandas. Let's get started. As you can see, I have come to my computer screen. You can use Python Pandas as long as you have Python installed. This is another library of Python. But some tools make the use of Python Pandas very easy for data science. And one of those tools is JetBrains PyCharm. You might know JetBrains PyCharm as an IDE. But there are some very interesting tools related to Jupyter Notebook. What is Jupyter Notebook? Jupyter Notebook helps you to do data analysis through Python Pandas. We will explore Jupyter Notebook in this video. But before that, I will install JetBrains PyCharm. If you install JetBrains PyCharm from the link given in the description, you will get an amazing offer. You can use PyCharm for free. But if you use the link given in the description, you will get the Pro version of PyCharm for free for 3 months. Which is a great deal. And yes, this video is sponsored by JetBrains. I reached out to JetBrains and they were kind enough to provide this support. So thanks a lot to JetBrains for sponsoring this video. So as soon as you click on the link given in the description, you will come to this page. Accept all. And put the coupon code that I have given in the description. So I have put the promo code here and I will fill this form and I will be back. As soon as you fill the form, you will get to see this page. And as soon as you go to your email, you will get instructions to install PyCharm Professional. Now while this is downloading, let me tell you that I am going to create a data science course end to end. And I have already started work on it. And I want to ask you that should I prioritize this course? And if you talk about prioritizing this course in the comment section below, Then I will bring this course to you before the end of this year, where the round of September and October will be coming. So you guys definitely tell me in the comment section below that should I prioritize this data science course? And if there are a lot of comments, then you will get to see the data science course on this channel very soon. Now as soon as you install PyCharm Professional, you will get to see this. On this screen, you guys click on New Project. And we will click on Jupyter here. And we will not put the data folder at all here. Now you see here it is saying No Conda Executable Found. So we will install Mini Conda. One of the biggest benefits of using Mini Conda is that it gives you a package manager which is specifically made for data science. So you are going to benefit a lot if you are working on your data science projects. We have installed Mini Conda here. And now we will click on Create here and our first Jupyter project will be created. Now you see here its name is Jupyter Project. You could have given any name to it. Now here you can see that there is already a sample Jupyter Notebook. Now what is this Jupyter Notebook? Jupyter Notebook can be a boon for your data science projects. How? You can write a notebook type Python code in Jupyter Notebook. What it means is that you can save your personal notes, headings, markdowns, and outputs along with the code. Jupyter Notebook looks something like this. And in this you have a code section, text segment, and you can add cells here. It has a cell concept. Cell means the building block of this particular iPython notebook. I will not focus too much on the iPython notebook here. I will discuss it in my data science course with you from scratch. If you comment, you will get to see the data science course very soon. But now what we will do here is we will prioritize Pandas. So let's come straight to Pandas which is the topic of this video. What is Python Pandas? Python Pandas is a data analysis and manipulation library in Python. It helps you in manipulating and wrangling data with data. Now what does this mean? If you have data, it can be in JSON file, CSV, Excel sheet. You can read it with the help of Python Pandas. Then you can pre-process that data with the help of Python Pandas. For example, you have an Excel sheet in which the data of the employees is there. Now you want to make another Excel sheet on which only the data of the employees is there which works with Python programming language. So you can use the Python programming language by applying the filter and by using the built-in features of Pandas, you can do this kind of work. Python Pandas effectively handles very large data sets. So let's see how to install and use Python Pandas. So I will zoom in a little bit here. Control scroll is not working here, so we will go to the file. We will go to settings and here we will go to editor, we will go to general and this change font size with control plus wheel, I will apply and ok. And I used to turn on this setting in my first Python course in JetBrains PyCharm. In my first ever Python course, so I remember a lot about it. Now what we will do here is simply write print introduction to Pandas. Now I will also teach you how to use the IPython notebook here. And you will get an idea why IPython notebook is amazing. Now see here that I double-clicked on it, so this markdown code is written. What I will do here is I will write introduction to Pandas. And here you can see I have written markdown. Introduction to Pandas is written, what is Pandas is written and why use Pandas is written. I will format it a little more and yeah it looks amazing now. So I can run any particular cell by pressing shift enter. Now here it is starting Jupyter server, which takes a little time. And what happens here is that with the help of Python runtime, you will get to see all these cells, the code cells, run and see. Here if you want to install any package, then you can do something like this. Like condas, conda install pandas and here as soon as I hit enter, I will hit shift enter. Now see here that this particular piece of code will install Pandas. So I have put an exclamation mark, which means run it in the terminal. And it is running conda install pandas in the terminal so that Python Pandas is installed. It takes a little time for me, the way we install a package by installing a package. We will use conda here because it is made specifically for data science. Now we have not installed condas here, we have used mini conda. Mini conda is a little lighter and it does not have a lot of packages from the beginning. That's why people prefer mini conda so that it doesn't put too much load on their machine. But here you can see that condas install pandas is taking a little time. And we will wait for it, it will take a little time and then we will come back. Now you can see here that it is telling me that all requested packages are already installed. Which means that all packages have already been installed. So let me tell you one thing that we have already installed pandas here. Now pandas has two types of key data structures. So I write this thing here in markdown and I delete this cell here. And I write directly here that there are two types of key data structures in pandas. What is the first data structure? The first data structure is series. And what is the second data structure? The second data structure is data frame. Which is very famous and I will write data frame here. And yes, so these are the two types of key data structures in pandas. So now what we will do is make a series. So what you have to do to make a series, you will write s is equal to and then write pd.series. And see here it is automatically suggesting me, I can complete it by pressing the tab. All thanks to AI assistant which is built in jetbrains. So I am using AI assistant jetbrains here. See here I wrote pd.series and I have not imported pandas here. So what I will do is I will import pandas first. What will I do to insert? Here I will hover and click on the code and a code cell will be inserted here. And I wrote import pandas as pd here. If I enter shift then it will run. Now if I enter shift then pd.series is running here. And now if I press s and enter shift then see here it has printed a series for me. Now you will say what is series? Because list is already there so what is the meaning of series? Pandas says series is a labelled array. List is an unlabelled array but series is a labelled array. I will show you what is the meaning of labelled array. Here when we press s and enter shift, you see 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 which are our index. Their corresponding value is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Now here the best benefit of using PyCharm is that it has features. Like you can visualize data directly from here. I can click here and visualize my data as a chart. Plus I can download it as png. So if I am visualizing data in pandas using PyCharm, I get to see these extra features along with AI assistant. And I liked one very good thing about their AI assistant that it is very accurate in context of Jupyter notebooks. So great work by PyCharm. And further we explore the series. I will tell you one more thing about the series. We have made a very basic series. What we can do is we can give labels in it. So if I give labels here like this, then what will happen is labels will be given in these values. And if I press shift and enter again, and my bad, these are not labels but indexes. And if I press shift and enter, then what will happen is these labels will be given. So when we don't give any index, then our index is by default 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. But if we give labels to it and pass that list to the index, then we get to see some label data like this. Now what is the work of this series? We will see this later. There is also a two-dimensional data structure in pandas which we call data frame. So let's see how we can make a data frame. We usually make data frame in df variable. And you can make it in any variable. But let me tell you that if you see any code on the internet, you will get to see df. Now if I write here pd.dataframe and after this I write pd.dataframe and give it a dictionary in some way. And I write names here. And in the names, I give, let's say, Harry. And with that I give Rohan. Then after this I give Shubham. And after this I give marks like this. And I will ensure that my marks are more. So I will make my marks 100 quickly because that is more important than this video. Make your marks 100. And I also increase their marks little by little. Otherwise they will feel bad. And obviously I will close it in double quotes because it is a python dictionary. And now if I print df, then you see it will be printed in 2D form like this. Now in pycharm, we get the option to sort it like this. You see here I can sort it alphabetically. And with that I can visualize it by clicking on this chart. Now see it gives you the best chart plot. According to this, it gives you the best way to visualize it. So this is a very good thing. And they have made a very good tool. You can also export it here as png. Traditionally, the jupyter notebook which opens in our web form in your chrome browser, you do not get to see all these features in it. So primarily in pandas, two data structures, one series, one data frame, series 1D, data frame 2D. I will write it here too. And here our data frame is 2D. Very good. Now suppose I have an excel sheet and I want to read it. In most of the cases, the data you will have will be in the form of some excel or in the form of some json. And to read it, pandas have built-in methods. For example, there is a method to read excel or csv in pandas. Read csv. And I will show you how you can read csv. Now I will show you here that if you right click in this data folder and do show in explorer, there is an option here, open in explorer. So you will see that this folder will open here. Now what I have done is download a csv from the internet, which you can also download. What we will do by right clicking, we will do open with excel. And you will see that the label data is inserted here. Now I want to read this data in pandas. How will I do it? What I will do simply is that I will write df is equal to and I will write here pd.read underscore csv and I will tap and what I will do here I will write data slash iris dot csv. This iris dot csv file, I am reading it here. I is capital. So here I write capital iris and you see as soon as I enter the shift here, iris data is inserted in my df. So if I enter the shift by writing df, then you see I have got this data frame here. And where did this data frame come from? It came from csv. You can also bring data from excel. You can also bring data frame from json. And there are methods to read data frame from different sources in pandas, which makes it a great tool. If you have to do this manually, then it will be very difficult for you. Either you will use a manual library and read it. If you use a library, then pandas are used more when we have to read excel. Now here in df, you will see that there is id, sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species. So this is a classical data set of machine learning. I want to tell you what happens in this that looking at the length of the sepal, looking at the width of the sepal, looking at the petal length and looking at the petal width, the species is predicted here. Looking at this whole data, it means that whatever new values come, they are predicted. And a lot of machine learning algorithms are trained on it. We leave all these things. Now we see how we can further analyze this data frame. First of all, the feature of the jupyter notebook, you will not get this feature in a normal jupyter notebook. The feature of pycharm is that you can click on this graph and see that your data has come here. So what is the main value of id here? And here is the index, which is not a very good interpretation according to me. This chart was automatically generated. You can change here what you want to see on the x-axis and what you want to see on the y-axis. So you can do all these things. You can plot different types of charts. You see here if you want a bar chart, you can plot a bar chart. If you want to plot a point here, you can do that too. So all these things you get very easily in the jupyter notebook. But now we will see the specific features of pandas. And we will see here what happens with df.head. So if you do df.head here, then you will get to see the initial 5 values. This data frame is very big. It has 150 rows. There are 6 columns. But here for your convenience, only 10 columns are shown to you in the jupyter notebook. And if you do df.head here, then you will get to see only 5 values in the beginning. The way you have df.head, you can also do df.tail here. And if you do df.tail here, then you will get the last 5. Then there is another method, df.describe, which helps you to describe this data frame. Like what is its count? What is the mean? How many values are there in it? What is the mean of those values? Then what is the standard deviation? What is the minimum value? What is the 25th percentile? What is the 50th percentile? What is the 75th percentile? All these values you can see here from df.describe. Then there is another method, df.info. And because this is a method, you will have to put parenthesis like this. As soon as I do shift enter, you will get here after putting df.info, what is the range index? What are the data columns? And what is their type? That is, you get to see information about your data columns. Now after this, we will see how you can do data selection. So I will write markdown here. And I will write here data selection because we are going to talk about data selection now. And this is markdown, there is no code. It is markdown, so I do ctrl x. I write markdown here something like this. And I delete these cells. Delete cell, delete cell. And I put a code cell below it and I will show you that if I want to see only ID here, then see me here. What do you get after writing df.id? You get ID like this. And here you see this 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, this is the index. Now I will show you a fun thing. If I print its type here, I will say, tell me the type of df.id. So this is a series which is our 1D data structure. The series we talked about in Pandas, this is that series. So in this way, you can extract one-dimensional data from Pandas. And obviously, this is going to be a series because it is going to be one-dimensional. Now I will remove the type from here. How will it be if you want ID along with, let us say, sepal length. Okay, so let's say I want sepal length and I also want ID. So what I will do here, I will write something like this. df and inside it, first of all, I will write ID by putting double quotes. ID. And after this, what will I do? I will write sepal length by putting comma like this and double quotes and in this way sepal length cm. And this time if I hit shift enter, then I will get to see a data frame in which ID and sepal length will be there. And obviously, what can I do here? I can plot its graph in this way or I can export its graph as PNG. Now what happens here is that sometimes I would like that the rows of my data frame I iterate. So what is going to be the most important function to do this work? What can you do here? You can write df.ilog and after this, as soon as you do zero, you will get to see the first row. This is not the first column, this is the first row. The ID of the first row is sepal length cm, sepal width, petal length in cm, petal width in cm, and species. So you get to see one data point here. Okay, if I talk about its type, then what will be its type? Would be very interesting to see. And you guessed right because it is a one-dimensional data, so its type will be Panda series. I will do it again like this and you can see here that I am getting to see only one particular row. Now here I am going to do a very interesting thing. What I will do is I will copy this iris.csv and here I will make a csv in the name of data.csv. I will open it in Excel and I will tell you what I am doing. You must be thinking what am I doing? Let me tell you what I am doing. What I will do now is delete some values like this. You see, I will delete a lot of values in the beginning like this. Now you will say why are you doing this? And I will close it by saving it. So this is our data.csv and what I did in this is I emptied some values. Okay? Cool. Now what I will do here I will come back to PyCharm and I will write here df2 is equal to and I will write here pd.read.csv and this time I will read data.csv and I will press shift enter and our df2 has come. Now if I do df2.head here then you see that I will get to see head like this. That is, the five rows in the beginning will be seen and I will get to see and I will get to see a lot of NANs in it. NAN, NAN, NAN. Now what I will do is I will not want to keep these NAN in my real data. So Pandas gives us a function which is .dropna. Okay? So what does this dropna do? It removes those rows which have missing data. And along with this, there is a function called fillna. If I do df.fillna here something like this. In fact, I had to do df2. I accidentally did df. If I press shift, then it has deleted this row. And you can see that after 5.1, 4.7 is coming. And there are many other rows with NAN. Like this row is also a row with NAN. It has also removed it. So it completely removes those data points which have NAN. Okay? Now you see here that if I do df2.fillna here, there is a function called fillna. Now what does fillna do? What can you do? You can fill the NAN. What values can you fill? Suppose you want to fill from 0. You want to fill the NAN from 0. Now there is a parameter here which is very interesting. In place is equal to true. Which in most of the cases you should not use. And the reason for this is that if you do this in place is equal to true, then what will happen? It will change the original data frame. And obviously we don't want that our original data frame changes in most of the cases. Because my df2 I don't want it to change. Obviously, I want to run some of its functions and I want to see the new data. That is fine. But I don't want that my df2 I want its original df2 which was here, which we did with csv, that changes. So whatever function I run df2. In most of the cases it is not going to change the data frame. But if I put in place is equal to true then my data frame will change. And this is really very important point. By doing in place is equal to true the original data frame changes. But we don't want to use it. And I will show you here as soon as I hit shift enter whatever na values in df2 will be filled from 0. How cool is that? Now if I show you again my df data frame then it looks like this. The df data frame was made by reading iris.csv if you don't remember. Now I will show you how we can change the columns. Suppose I want to write sepal length as sl. I want to write in short form. So what I will do is there is a method called df.rename I will use that method. And what I will do here I will give a columns parameter. Suppose I want to change sepal length centimeter. And I want to call it sl. So I will give a column parameter like this. And what will this syntax do? It will change the columns of my data frame. If I hit shift enter then I will get a new data frame. Which will make sepal length cm as sl. Did my original data frame change? If I hit shift enter by writing df then did my original data frame change? No. This becomes a new data frame here whenever I run functions on data frame. But if I have made inplace is equal to true here I will show you by doing it this time. I have made inplace is equal to true if I hit shift enter. Then it will change my data frame. So now if I hit shift enter of data frame then my original data frame will change. So inplace is equal to true it is not that you don't have to use it. Don't use it by mistake. I just mean to say that whatever you are doing you should know what you are doing. If you are using inplace is equal to true then you should know what inplace is equal to true does. Now if I describe df. Suppose I describe df. again. So you guys see here. What will it do? It will tell me all the values here. And if I do df.info then it will give me information. Now see it is telling me that the id is int64. And our sl which was our sepal length it is saying that it is float64. It is floating point number. And pandas automatically infers these types. For some reason if I want that my sepal width or sepal length which is sl I want to make it int. I want to store it in the form of int64 bit integer. So I can do that. And for that we have a method which is df.asType. So what I will do? I will write here something like this. I will say that see the sl of df the sl of df is equal to df and here I will write sl and here I will write .asType and let's say I want to store it as an integer. I will hit shift enter. And this time I will do df.info I will show you that our sl is now int64. And if I show you df then you will see that all the sl values are now integer values. Should I do this? Obviously I will lose precision. But again something that you can do. Always. If you want to do it you can change the data types. You can also do string. I will show you. If you want to do string df.asType let's say you do str and you hit shift enter like this then here it becomes an object. Why is it an object? Because string is also an object. And here I hit shift enter. So you see here our sl is now a string. So if I do something like this df.sl I will write df.sl first and then I will write 0 here. And I will hit shift enter. So you see as a string I am getting 5. Now here I would like to put some light on this thing. You will say that when you wrote str then why did it become an object? I didn't understand anything. It seems a bit strange. So historically what used to happen that in pandas apart from some values all the python objects they were stored in the form of obj. In the form of object. That is, it was stored in the form of python object. And from version 1 the first version of pandas version 2. something came. After that the version 1 of pandas came. From that you guys get to see a dedicated type of string. Which you can use in any way if you want to use it. So if you give a string in double quotes and hit shift enter then it will show you a string. So see a string type too pandas has introduced. Now this d type it is defined in pandas. So int64 is done, float64 is done. String is done. Similarly, if you write str then you will get to see the object. Any python object you write you will get to see the object. But if you specifically need a string then you can write it in the form of a string. Again it is not relevant for this context. Because why do you want to use saplenth as a string? It is a matter of thinking. But again it is something that you can do. Always. So now you see here the value will not make any difference. But again I wanted to tell you this thing. Now after this if you do len df then you will get to see how many rows are in the data frame. Then if you want to add a new column then you can do something like this. Suppose you want to add a zeros name. So what will you do? You will give a list like this and you will write here 0 for i in range len of df. So what will happen with this? A list of zeros will be formed. You will hit shift enter and after that you will see df. So a column named zeros will be added. Again this can be any other python list which has some relevant values. But this is something that you can always do. Now suppose you want to add a plus 2. Suppose I did this. You want to add something like this. Suppose you want to add a column by adding zeros plus 1. And I will tell you what I want to say here. So what can you do here? You can apply a function in a particular value. What will you do here? You will write the name of the function. So what will I do here? I will write a function fx and I will define this function here. I will write a very simple function. Oops, I hit shift enter here by mistake. I will write df and I will write fx. And I will define this. I will return here. Suppose a plus 1. And a will be the parameter. I will put a here like this. And I will hit shift enter. And it is saying that key error 0 plus 1 not defined. So zeros is already a column. So what I am saying is add a new column named zeros plus 1. And how will you do it? Now you will say apply this function in zeros. So this function will be applied in all values of 0 fx. Now see how it works. So if I write df again here, then a new field will be added. Its name is zeros plus 1. And maybe I could have done it better by squaring the petal length. So maybe if I do it a into a. And I do not do zeros here. Suppose I do sl. So what will happen? And I hit shift enter here. So you will see that the square of sl. Now it is saying can't multiply a sequence by non-it. Okay, we made sl a string. So my bad. We have to write petal length cm here. So I do one thing. I write here petal length cm. Something like this. And it auto-suggests. Again feature of the IDE. I will hit shift enter. And you see what I have done here. That I have to get the square of these values here. So if I want to infer a new column from a particular value, then I can do that. And I can provide a function. According to this function, make a new value from this value for all rows. Okay, now after that, suppose you have done processing on a data. Now you want me to save my df as an excel. So you can do 2csv or 2xl something like this here. Now here index is equal to false is written. Otherwise, index is added by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So I do one thing for you. Index is equal to false. I remove it and show. Then after this I will show you. So I will export it in the name of export.csv. So I am saying df.2csv. Data slash export.csv. And here in the data, an export.csv will be made. I don't know why it didn't make. I refresh. Doesn't refresh here? Come on, in the name of export.csv, in a data. It should be made. Let's see what's wrong. Yes, it is made export.csv. So you see what it has done here. That all the values are exported as a csv file. It has added a new column here. Which is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Which is index. And I personally don't want that. Why? Because this 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by doing this, we have got row numbers here. I don't need this in most of the cases. I would like to get my excel in this way. So what will I do? I will save it as a don and I will delete it. I will make index equal to false here. So what will it do? The index will not add me. So if I enter shift now, then the new file will be made. You will see that this export has been done. Our new file has this 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 index column. It is not added. So in this way, you can export. Now what I will do here is how to merge you people. I will tell you. I will make df1 equal to pd.dataframe. And after doing pd.dataframe, what will I do here? What will I do here? I will make a list by naming it. And let's say I give it Harry. And then after this, I do Rohan Shubham here. And after this, let's say I do Shivam. And after this, I do Divya here. I do Aparna. Divya, Aparna. Aparna. Aparna. And after this, I also do Khushi. So I put in the name Harry, Rohan, Shubham, Divya, Aparna, Khushi. After this, I also add their marks. Now Harry, Rohan, Shubham have good marks. Shivam has three numbers. Divya has 100 out of 100. Aparna has 95. And Khushi has three numbers. So I have made our dataframe. Now you see here, if I shift enter df1 in this way, then this is our very basic df1. Now let's say I make df2. Listen to me carefully. I am making df2 here. I made df2. Let's say I put some new names in this. Let's say I put Akash. And I put Akasa. I put Alka. I put Aparna. Aparna is already done. So let's do one thing, let's put Priyanka instead of Aparna. And here there are four values. So we will keep four values. So you see 3, 100, 95 and 3. I put four values here. So my df2 is made. So my df1 looks like this. So you see df2 looks like this. Now let's say I want to merge these two. So what I will do, I will write df1.concat And after writing concat, what I will do concat And here I will write df2 in this way. And I will hit shift enter. So it is giving me an error. Attribute error. In fact, this is a wrong syntax. I will put pd.concat and df1 and df2 in this way. And see what will happen. These two data frames will be concatenated. Now there is one more concept. That is to merge data frames. And what does it mean to merge? Let's say it also has a name Akash, Akasa, Alka and Priyanka. And if the same thing was here too. I do one thing, I make a new data frame. And make df1 again. So I will write here pd.dataframe and here I will write something like this. I will put only two values here. Akash and Priyanka. I will put Akash and Priyanka. I will put Akash and Priyanka. And let's put their marks too. Something like this. And we will put only two values here. Now Akash and Priyanka's marks. Oops, I have done something wrong here. I did not put a square bracket. One minute, I should have put a square bracket here. Now it's fine. So I made df1 like this. And I will make it in df2 in a very similar way. How will I make df2? First of all, I will show you how df1 is looking. df1 is looking like this. Now what I will do in df2, I will use the same values but not using marks. What will I do? I will use something else in this. What is roll number? ROLL. Let's say roll number is 1244 and 1245. Now what I want is to merge df2 and df1. So if I show df2, it looks like this. df1 is looking like this. Akash's marks and Akash's roll number. Priyanka's marks and Priyanka's roll number. Now what I can do here is I can merge these two data frames. So to make a new merged data frame, I will use pd.merge. And here I will say df1, df2. And there is a parameter called on I will name it on. On is equal to name means merge it on name. So if I hit shift and enter here, you will get a new data frame in which Akash's marks and roll number will come both. Priyanka's marks and roll number will come both. Now what would have happened if there was a value like this. Let's say there is Harry here and there is no Harry above. And Harry's roll number is 1255. So I will hit shift and enter here. I will run all of them. Now what would have happened if there were Harry's marks here and Harry's roll number here. So what would have happened here is that Harry will not be shown here because the name is here Harry is here and not here. So this is the reason. So what does it do? It skips the values of pd.merge which are not in both the data frames. Now JetBrains PyCharm supports data science very well.
